While the base /source directory can be used for experimentation, when it is time to deploy research to a production environment, reimplement a

The contents of this folder should be portable, meaning it is inclusive of any config files, the queries folder (if needed) and completely independent of 
higher-level directories. The data folder can be configured through command line arguments.
